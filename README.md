# Stroke-Prediction
Stroke Prediction using 3 Classification Models(LR, RF and XGBoost)

==> Basic EDA
==> Feature Scaling
==> Data balancing using SMOTE
==> GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning of models
==> Final result - 1) Random Forest Classifier-> accuracy= 96.17% & recall=0.96
                   2) XGBClassifier -> accuracy = 96.13% & recall = 0.96

– Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest & XGBoost models using scikit-learn library to predict
the likelihood of a stroke in patients; Performed 10-fold cross-validation to prevent the model from overfitting.

– Optimized model through hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV & achieved recall of 0.96 on the test dataset
